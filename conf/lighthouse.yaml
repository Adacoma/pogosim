# The initial positions of the robot, set as a formation.
# "initial_formation" can be:
#   - "random": all robots are placed randomly in the arena, with random direction,
#   - "aligned_random": all robots are placed randomly in the arena, all with with pi/2 direction.
#   - "random_near_walls": all robots are placed randomly, as close as possible to the walls to the arena, with random direction.
#   - "aligned_random_near_walls": all robots are placed randomly, as close as possible to the walls to the arena, all with with pi/2 direction.
#   - "disk": robots are placed uniformly in a disk shape at the center of the arena.
#   - "lloyd": robots are placed randomly with an approximately equi-spaced distribution
#       by running a few iterations of Lloyd’s relaxation (a.k.a. “K-means” on a dense uniform sample).
#       This method assumes all objects/robots have the same radius.
#   - "power_lloyd" (default): Similar approach to "lloyd", but using a weighted approach (Laguerre diagrams)
#       to handle cases where objects/robots do not have the same radius.
#   - "imported": import the (X, Y, angle) coordinates from a csv or feather dataframe specified by parameter "formation_filename".
#       E.g.:
#               formation_filename: "/tmp/data.feather"
#       By default, the coordinates from the csv/feather file will not be rescaled, and must be in the same units as the simulation.
#       As such, a feather file generated from the results of another simulation with the same arena can directly be used: if a 'time' column is present in the
#       dataframe, only the coordinates of agents at t=0s are used. If the coordinates do not originate from a simulation, they may be specified in different
#       units as the simulation: in this case, it is necessary to specify the "imported_formation_min_coords" and "imported_formation_max_coords" to correspond
#       to the lower and upper bounds of the coordinate system. All provided coordinates will then be rescaled to match those of the simulation. E.g.
#               imported_formation_min_coords: [0.0, 0.0]
#               imported_formation_max_coords: [17.0, 17.0]
#       Note that the angle (aka "theta") column is optional: if it is not provided, the angle will be sampled from a [-pi, pi] uniform distribution.
#   - chessboard: robots are placed on a regular grid, with random direction.
#       The distance between each grid point (robot center) specified by the 'chessboard_distance_between_neighbors' parameter.
#       As such, if the distance is enough, the robots will only have max 4 neighbors corresponding to the 4 directions top, left, bottom, right.
#       The "formation_cluster_at_center" parameter (default=true) specifies whether (true) all robots should put as close as possible to the center of the grid (i.e. center of the arena); or (false) if they should just be placed randomly in the grid.
#   - aligned_chessboard: similar to formation "chessboard", but all robots have a pi/2 direction.
